Vanilla JavaScript:


This is plain, pure JavaScript without any libraries or frameworks added. It’s just the core language—exactly how the browser understands it.

You write everything yourself from scratch

Full control over code structure and behavior

No rules or conventions imposed

Excellent for small projects or learning fundamentals


JavaScript Frameworks (like React, Angular, Vue):

These are pre-built tools that help you build complex apps faster and more efficiently.

They come with patterns, rules, and built-in features (like routing, state management)

Handle a lot of repetitive tasks for you

Promote organized architecture and scalability

Can be opinionated—meaning you need to follow their way of doing things
