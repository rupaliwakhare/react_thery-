what is jsx?

JSX stands for JavaScript XML, and it's a syntax extension for JavaScript used mostly in React, a popular library for building user interfaces.

What's so special about JSX?
JSX lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript. Instead of using traditional createElement functions, you can just write:
const greeting = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
This makes your code more readable and expressive—especially when building UI components.



Behind the scenes:
Browsers don’t understand JSX natively.

It gets transpiled by tools like Babel into regular JavaScript, like:

js
const greeting = React.createElement('h1', null, 'Hello, world!');

Why use JSX?
Cleaner and more intuitive layout

Easier to visualize component structure

Combines markup and logic in one file—perfect for modern UI design
