In React, components are the building blocks of the user interface. They let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.

🧩 Types of Components in React


1. Functional Components
Defined as JavaScript functions.

Simpler and preferred for most use cases.

Can use Hooks (like useState, useEffect) for state and lifecycle features.

jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}


2. Class Components

Defined using ES6 classes.

Can hold internal state and lifecycle methods.

Less commonly used now due to Hooks.

jsx
class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}




🛠️ Key Concepts of React Components
🔄 Props (Properties)


Passed from parent to child component.

Read-only data used to customize components.

jsx
<Welcome name="Alice" />
📦 State


Internal data managed by the component.

Can change over time and trigger re-renders.

jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);


🔁 Lifecycle (Class Components)
Methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount.

Used to run code at specific points in a component’s life.

🧱 Component Composition
Components can contain other components.

Encourages reuse and clean architecture.

jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <MainContent />
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}


🎯 Why Components Matter
Promote reusability and separation of concerns.

Make code easier to test, maintain, and scale.

Enable declarative UI development.
