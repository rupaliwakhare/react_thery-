what is rendering?

Rendering is the process of generating a visual output from code or data—essentially turning raw materials into something you can see on a screen. It’s used in everything from websites to video games, and even animated movies.

In Web Development:

Rendering refers to how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are transformed into the visual webpage you interact with.

It can happen on the client-side (in your browser) or server-side (on a remote server before sending to your browser).



In Graphics & Games:


Rendering is how 3D models, textures, and lighting data become realistic scenes and gameplay visuals.

It includes processes like ray tracing (simulating light behavior) or rasterization (converting shapes into pixels).



In Animation & Film:


Rendering takes complex 3D scenes and turns them into frames of video or still images.

Often uses powerful computers to handle lighting, shadows, reflections, and more.
